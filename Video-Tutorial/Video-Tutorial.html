        <h1>Video Embedding Tutorial!</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone who can even see this! Today I will be guiding you through how to embed a video from YouTube into your own webpage! Let's get started!</p>
        <h2>Step 1: Choose your video</h2>
        <p>To embed a video, you first have to go to the video hosting site and choose your video. For this example I will be choosing a video by SwipesMC from YouTube.</p>
        <img src="../Root_Directory_Folder/Images/Choose-Video.png">
        <h2>Step 2: How to get the embedding code</h2>
        <p>To embed the video, you need to have the html code to do it! So when you have chosen your video, click on the three dots and then click the "Share" option.</p>
        <img src="../Root_Directory_Folder/Images/Share.png">
        <h2>Step 3: Embed Option</h2>
        <p>Once you've clicked share, a popup box should appear with mulitple options of various platforms to share the video on. Click on the one that says "Embed". Once you do that, another popup should appear. It will have text that will look like the second picture.</p>
        <img src="../Root_Directory_Folder/Images/Embed.png">
        <p class="caption">Popout after you click "Share"</p>
        <img src="../Root_Directory_Folder/Images/Embed-Code.png">
        <p class="caption">Text in new popout from "Embed"</p>
        <h2>Step 4: Copy Paste</h2>
        <p>Now that you have the code to embed the video, all that you have to do is copy and paste that code into your html file.</p>

        <h2 class="OMG">Step 5: DON'T FORGET TO UPLOAD</h2>
        <p>It is CRITICAL to upload your file to your website hosting service. If not, then the video will give you an error message. I found this out the hard way, literally spending hours trying to figure out what was wrong. Make sure that you upload the file into whatever website hosting service you use. It should look something like this:</p>
        <img src="../Root_Directory_Folder/Images/Uploading.png">
        <h2>The End!</h2>
        <p>You've made it! That's all there is to it! Just check your webpage to make sure that the video plays and is where you want it. It should look something like this at the end.</p>
