<p style="clear:both;">The <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; font-family:Garamond, serif; font-size:1.25em;">PR</span>esionistas, established in October of 2024 were a group of people joined by the ties of Saz&oacute;n in order to share the gift of Presi&oacute;n with the world. Constantly seeking to improve themselves, they stay a tight knit group of individuals who stop, collaborate, and listen in order to enhance each other's skills. Since their founding, their levels of Presi&oacute;n have increased exponentially, and they have added new members to their cause. Their message to the world: <span style="font-style:italic;">Stay rizzy</span></p>
